# C# UNO

### About
This is a terminal-based attmept to recreate the popular game  This was created in an afternoon hackathon 
with a small team of classmates. The game allows one player to play games against 1-8 computer opponents.
Hands are represented by printing the various cards with their respective color and value. Validation
prevents users from trying to play invalid cards and prompts the player to draw cards when required.
Computer opponents run their turns in order and play the first valid card in their hand.  Each turn is
posted to the terminal to allow the player to more easily follow the flow of the game.  When a game is won,
the player will be given a chance to restart the game or quit.
